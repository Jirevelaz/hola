### Data Projection
The Pacemaker App does not require an Internet connection and does not share, nor store, any information central. 
All information stored by the APP is stored on the users devices. 

### Broadcasting Information to nearby users. 
By the nature of this App, some data is visible to nearby users (shared currently with Bluetooth).
This information includes: 
- The current Heart Rate of the user
- The defined 'Heart Rate limit' of the user
- The defined user name
- The userId (which is a random number assigned at first start of the application)
